## Brief of our Work
As a part of our approach to the PS, we started with a YOLOv8 to segment the monitor screen from the rest of the background. But we had identified one problem here - drawing quadrilateral bounding boxes, which YOLO is inherently incapable of doing. This inspired us to build our own model for the same, inspired by the loss function used in YOLO - LDRNet.
