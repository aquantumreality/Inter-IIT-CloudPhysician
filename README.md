## Brief of our Work

The Vital Extractor model built by Team-13 leverages segmentation, object detection, colour segmentation and edge detection to achieve state of the art results for detecting various kinds of vitals namely Heart Rate, Blood Pressure , SPO<sub>2</sub> and Respiration Rate with their corresponding graphs(if any) from the monitor.

Unlike existing object detectors we make use of a novel detector that gives non rectangular bounding boxes as well. Using this as the base of our object detector, we use state of the art methods(such as yolo) to do color based detection and refinement of the vitals present on screen. To top it all off, we make use of a custom edge detector to digitise the graphs present on the monitor screen yielding promising results.
